/**
 * A LinkedList stores data in nodes consisting of the data value and the reference/pointer to its
 * next node.
 * <p>
 * Insertion and deletion from a linked list takes O(1) unlike with arrays that have O(n) for the
 * worst case.
 * <p>
 * Linked lists do not allow random access to its node. LinkedLists support dynamic size and can be
 * singly or doubly
 * <p>
 * A Singly linkedList has nodes that contain only a pointer to its next node A Doubly linked list
 * has nodes with pointers to the previous and next nodes.
 * <p>
 * Linked lists are represented as a single node which is first node/head of the list
