/**
 * The Heap is a complete Binary Tree in which all levels are completely filled
 * except the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.
 *
 * Heaps can be Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min Heap the root node has the smallest
 * value in the tree. In a max Heap the root node has the largest value in the node.
 *
 * Unlike the Binary Search Tree, the heap allows for duplicates and is not sorted.
 *
 * Heaps can be implemented with arrays. Java's default impl for the heap is the Priority Queue.
 * Heap Sort uses an heap to sort an array in nLog n time.
 *
 * Insert and delete operations in the heap takes O(log n) time while getMin takes O(1) time in a
 * minimum heap
