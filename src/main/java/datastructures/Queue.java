 * Like in a queue of people or processes, the first inserted element is retrieved first and ne
 * elements are always added to the end of the queue
 * <p>
 * Operations possible on a queue are: enqueue to add, dequeue to remove
 * <p>
 * Queues can be implemented with arrays or linked list.
 * <p>
 * Java contains an inbuilt interface called Queue and implemented by LinkedList class and can
 * perform FIFO operation It can perform add, remove and peek for insertion, retrieval and look up
