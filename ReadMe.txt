//todo:
use interfaces to represent data structures
learn dfs extensive
work with dfs back tracking
implement a queue with two stacks

//todo
implement pre order, post order and in order for graphs
define time and space complexities for the data structure interfaces of the
find a way to continue to study the interfaces of data the data structures
study dynamic programming
